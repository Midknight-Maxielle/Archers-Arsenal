Bowyer (Copyright Midknight.Maxielle 2021)

Bowyer is a mod to balance and scale bows in the same way that swords do; with tiers of items. It also tries to lessen the importance of grinding for Infinity, by making it built in for certain bow tiers and providing a range of arrow options. 

It is licensed under GNU Public License 3.0, which, TLDR; it's free and open-source software, and your only obligation

Special thanks to many open-source modders and tutorial-makers in making this, too many to count, but in particular:
